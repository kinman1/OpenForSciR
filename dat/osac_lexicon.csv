A,Accelerating Voltage,"The voltage/electrical potential applied to the filament that accelerates the electrons emitted by the electron gun/filament. In general, increasing the accelerating voltage will decrease the spherical aberration of the system and, consequently, increase the resolution.    However, varying the acceleration voltage also affects the beam-specimen interaction. Consequently, if a higher accelerating voltage is used, the interaction volume between the beam and specimen will be bigger. This needs to be considered when analyzing small particles as the interaction volume may exceed the size of the particle.  SE images obtained using low kV accelerating voltages (5 to 10 kV) provide exceptional topographical information because the beam interaction is confined to regions very close to the surface. As a result, the yield of BSE is low using low kV accelerating voltages.  Conversely, using high kV (20 to 30 kV) accelerating voltages, much higher yields of BSE are obtained due to the deeper penetration and interaction volume of the beam.  As the accelerating voltage increases, so does the detectability of higher atomic number elements. The accelerating voltage needs to be a minimum of 20 kV to permit generation of (and detection thereof) the Lead ‘L’ lines.",Gunshot Residue (Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis),2018-02-23

For any solid material, the rate and ease of combustion depend as much on the state of subdivision as on its chemical nature; thus cellulose is combustible in the form of paper or textile fibers, but flammable in the form of  fibers  (e.g., cotton linters).  Solid magnesium will not ignite at less than 1200 F, whereas thin flakes or powder will burn easily and rapidly ( as well as other metal powders).       The definition of combustible liquids differs by various organizations that are active in the field of hazardous materials are unfortunately far from uniform.  For example the National Fire Protection Associations considers them as liquids having a flash point above 140 F (Tag Closed Cup).  The interstate Commerce Commission uses a flash point of 80 F as the dividing line between flammable and combustible.

NOTE 2 “Parameter” is defined in ISO 3534-1. The parameter can be, for example, a standard deviation or a given multiple of it.

Other components, which can also be characterized by standard deviations, are evaluated from assumed probability distributions based on experience or other information.

NOTE 5 Uncertainty is distinguished from an estimate attached to a test or measurement result that characterizes the range of values within which the expectation is asserted to lie.

For samples having large topographical variation, a longer working distance is required to bring as much of the image into focus as possible. However, some of the resolution will be lost.
