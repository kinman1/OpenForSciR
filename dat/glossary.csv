,sourcecode,Source Code ,"The part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a ""program"" or ""application""—works. ",opensource.com,https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source
,evidence,Evidence,"Data presented to a court or jury in proof of the facts in issue and which may include the testimony of witnesses, records, documents, or objects.",dictionary.com,https://www.dictionary.com/browse/evidence
,score,Score,The quanitification of similarity between two items via a univariate function meant to inform whether the two items have a common source.,@hepler2012score,
,lr,Likelihood Ratio,"Statistical measurement evaluating the probability of evidence under one hypotheis, divided by the probability of evidence under an alternative, mutually exclusive hypothesis. In forensic science, the value of the likelihood ratio expresses the weight and meaning of scientific evidence and is used as a measure of probative value.",CSAFE,https://forensicstats.org/resources/glossary/
DNA,dnaprof,DNA profiling ,"A method of identifying an individual through comparison of patterns arising from differences in DNA sequences, represented as a string of values compiles from the results of DNA testings at one or more genetic markers.",@butler09,
,pcr,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR),An *in vitro* process that yields millions of copies of desired DNA through repeated cycling of a reaction involving the DNA polymerase enzyme.,@butler09,
,str,Short Tandem Repeats (STRs),Multiple copies of an identical DNA sequence arranged in direct succession where the repeat  sequence unit is 2 to 6 base pairs in length. ,@butler09,
,snp,Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP),Any polymorphic variation at a single nucleotide.,@butler09,
,mtdna,Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),"A small, circular DNA molecule located in the mitocondria that contains approximately 16,500 nucleotides. The abundance of hundreds of copies of mtDNA in each cell make it useful with samples originating from limited or damaged biological material.",@butler09,
