# Firearms: bullets {#bullets}

## Introduction

When a bullet is fired from a gun barrel, striation markings from imperfections in the barrel manufacturering process are imprinted onto what is called the Land Impression region of the bullet. These impressions are assumed to be unique to individual gun barrels, and as a result, traditional forensic science methods have employed trained forensic examiners to assess the likelihood of two bullets being fired from the same barrel (a "match"). Conventionally, this has been done using the metric Consecutively Matching Striae, or CMS. However, no official standards have been established to scientifically delineate a number that effectively separates matches from non-matches. Therefore, significant work has been done, and continues to be done, in order to add scientific rigor to the bullet matching process.

## Data 

Data on both breech face and land impressions are available from the NIST Ballistics Database Project in the x3p (XML 3-D Surface Profile) format. This format was designed to implement a standard for exchanging 3D profile data. This format was adopted by the Open Forensic Metrology Consortium, or OpenFMC, a group of firearm forensics researchers whose aim is to establish best practices for researchers using metrology in forensic science.

Figure \@ref(fig:x3pcontain) shows an illustration of the internal structure of the x3p file format. x3p files contain an XML data file with metadata on the bullet scans, as well as binary data containing the surface topology measurements. The metadata includes information on the scanning equipment and operator, as well as information on the resolution of the scans.
