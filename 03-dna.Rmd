## Introduction

The earliest documented^[See [this interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b008fcdz) at 19:23.] use of DNA profiling in the legal system was an immigration dispute in the United Kingdom. A young man of Ghanaian descent with family in the UK was believed to have forged his Ghanaian passport and had an expired British passport. DNA profiling techniques developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys were used to prove that the he was indeed his mother's son, and thus he did have a right to immigrate to the UK. The technique was subsequently used for many other parentage cases, and soon after, DNA profiling was used for the first time to convict someone of a crime [@butler09].

When DNA profiling began, an individual's blood sample was taken to create their DNA profile. Now, DNA can be taken by a cheek swab, and the minute traces of touch DNA can tie a perpetrator to the scene of the crime. This is thanks to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method of copying a DNA sample over and over again to amplify the genetic signal for profile extraction. Once a DNA sample is amplified with PCR, different DNA markers can be analyzed to make an identification. The standard for forensic DNA typing is to use short tandem repeats or STRs as the DNA marker. Other markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), have different uses. SNPs can be used to identify ancestry or visible traits of a human, while mtDNA is used in cases where DNA is highly degraded [@dnareview]. Because STR is the standard, we dedicate the rest of this chapter to its methodology. 

### Procedure for DNA Analysis using STRs

In order to understand the STR methodology, we first need to understand what is being analysed. We present the comparison of genetic and printed information from @butler09 in Table \@ref(tab:comparetable). When forensic scientists analyze a DNA sample, they are looking for repeated "words" or DNA sequences in different "paragraphs," or loci. The locus information is stored in the chromosome, which is the "page" the genetic information is on. Your *chromosomes* exist in the *nucleus* of every *cell* in your body, just like a *page* is within a *chapter* in a *book* in a *library*.  STR markers are a set of loci or genes. At each locus, the number of times a tetranucleotide sequence repeats is counted [@butler05]. This count indicates the allele, or gene variation, at that particular locus. 

```{r comparetable, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
x <- c("Library", "Book", "Chapter", "Page", "Paragraph", "Word", "Letter")
y <- c("Body", "Cell", "Nucleus", "Chromosome", "Locus or gene", "Short DNA sequence", "DNA nucleotide")
knitr::kable(data.frame(x,y), col.names = c("Printed Information", "Genetic Information"), caption = "Recreation of Table 2.1 from @butler09")
```

In forensic DNA profiling, a particular set of 15 or more loci are examined for comparison. The number of loci in the set depends on the equipment used to analyzed the DNA sample.  These sets of loci were chosen because of their high variability in the population. To find the alleles at each loci, the DNA sample is amplified using PCR, and then run through capillary electrophoresis (CE). The result of CE is the DNA profile, with the alleles on each locus indicated by different colored peaks from a chemical dyeing process. For interpreting the results of the chemical analysis, the loci need to be described in terms of their stutter ratio, heterozygote peak balance, inter-locus balance, and stochastic threshold. 

These four measurments, however, are subject to random change due to the replication process. In addition, different labs may use different machines and materials in forensic analysis resulting in different measurements for the same DNA sample. Thus, the validation of methods and materials is a crucial step. According to the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM), "validation is a process by which a procedure is evaluated to determine its efficacy and reliability for forensic casework and/or database analysis" [@swgdamval] Validation helps minimize error in forensic DNA analysis and helps keep results consistent across laboratories and materials.

The process of validation for forensic DNA methodology is expensive, time consuming, and unstandardized, and the R package `strvalidator` was created to help solve these problems in forensic DNA [@strval]. The `strvalidator` package makes the validation process faster by automating data analysis with respect to "heterozygote balance, stutter ratio, inter-locus balance, and the stochastic threshold" [@strval]. In the remainder of this chapter, we'll introduce the data for this package, how to use the package, and show one validation process in R.  


## Data 

The `strvalidator` package takes files exported from the GeneMapper® software, or a similar software that exports tab-delimited text files, as inputs. The data exported from these software programs typically come in a very wide format, and on import it needs to be transformed into a long format more appropriate for data analysis. In Figure \@ref(fig:widelonggif), we show and example of data being transformed from wide to long format and back. In wide format, the group variable values are column names, while in the long format they become part of the data.

```{r widelonggif, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Animation heuristic showing the transformation from long form to wide form data and back.

knitr::include_graphics("https://omnianalytics.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/file35535a5445eb.gif")
```

The `strvalidator` package contains import methods to make sure that the data imported from other software is in the right form for validation analysis. The GeneMapper® software creates one column for each of 20 possible alleles and their corresponding sizes, heights, and data points. 



## R Package(s)

The package `strvalidator` has a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform analyses so that no coding knowledge is necessary to run these analyses. The author of the package, Oskar Hansson, has written an extensive tutorial^[*STR-validator* 2.0.0 tutorial, published 8 August 2017 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2v6NDpFIgvDel9wSlFfb3hvekk/view).] on the GUI. As this book is focused on open science, we do not use the GUI because it does not output the underlying code used for the point-and-click analyses done in the GUI. Instead, we use the code underlying the GUI directly. 

- main functions 
- focus on stutter analysis 

## Drawing Conclusions

- what is the stutter ratio? 
- what does it mean for our data? 

## Case Study

<!--
There are four pieces in validation: 
1. stutter ratio 
2. heterozygote balance (intra-locus balance)
3. inter-locus balance 
4. stochastic threshold. 
-->

### Get the data

We'll use the package data `set1`, which is data from the genotyping of eight replicate measurments of a  positive control sample, one replicate of a negative control sample, and the ladder used in analysis. The PowerPlex® ESX 17 System from the Promega Corporation^[Technical manual [here](https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/101/powerplex-esx-17-system-protocol.pdf?la=en)] was used on these samples for amplification of 17 loci recommended for analysis by the European Network fo Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) and the European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP), the European equivalent of SWGDAM. The known reference sample used is the `ref1` data in the `strvalidator` package. 

First, load the data, then slim it for analysis. 

```{r set1}
library(strvalidator)
library(dplyr)
data(set1)
head(set1)
# slim and trim the data
set1.slim <- slim(set1, fix = c("Sample.Name", "Marker", "Dye"),
                  stack = c("Allele", "Height"), keep.na = FALSE)
dim(set1)
dim(set1.slim)
head(set1.slim)
```

Next, get the reference sample data. 

```{r ref1}
data(ref1)
head(ref1)
ref1.slim <- slim(ref1, fix = c("Sample.Name", "Marker"), 
                  stack = "Allele", keep.na = FALSE)
head(ref1.slim)
```

```{r}
plotsamples <- set1.slim %>% filter(Sample.Name != "Ladder", Allele != "OL", Marker != "AMEL") %>% 
  sortMarker(kit = "ESX17", add.missing.levels = TRUE)
ggplot() + 
   geom_segment(data = ref1.slim %>% filter(Marker != "AMEL"), aes(x = Allele, xend = Allele, y = -Inf, yend = Inf), alpha = .7) +
  geom_line(data = plotsamples, aes(x = Allele, y = as.numeric(Height), group = Sample.Name, color=Sample.Name), alpha = .7) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") + 
  facet_wrap(~Marker, ncol = 4, scales = "free") + 
  labs(x = "Allele (True allele shown in black)", y = "Peak Height", color = "Sample")
```


### Check the stutter ratio 

```{r stutterfig, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%", fig.cap="Figure 2 from @strval. The analysis range, 2 back stutters and 1 forward stutter is shown at 3 levels of overlap."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/strval-fig2.jpg")
```

Stutter peaks are byproducts of the DNA amplification process, and their presence muddles data interpretation [@strval]. Stutter is caused by strand slippage in PCR [@butler09]. This slippage causes small peaks to appear next to true peaks, and a threshold is needed to determine if a peak is caused by slippage or if it could be a mixture sample with a minor contributor. We calculate the stutter for the eight replicates in `set1` using one vack stuffer, no formward stutter and no overlap. We compare these values to the 95th percentiles in Table 3 of @strval. See Figure \@ref(fig:stutterfig) for an example of stutter.   


```{r stutter, fig.cap="Stutter ratios by allele for each of the eight samples in the `set`` data, computed for one back stutter, zero forward stutter, and no overlap. Horizontal dotted lines represent the 95th percentile of stutter ratio values from the study done in @strval."}
# make sure the right samples are being analyzed 
checkSubset(data = set1.slim, ref = ref1.slim)
# supply the false stutter and true stutter values for your data. these are from the GUI. 
stutter_false_val <- c(-1.9, -1.8, -1.7, -0.9, -0.8, -0.7, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7)
stutter_replace_val <- c(-1.3, -1.2, -1.1, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)
# calculate the stutter values 
set1_stutter <- calculateStutter(set1.slim, ref1.slim, back = 1, forward = 0, interference = 0, 
                 replace.val = stutter_false_val, by.val = stutter_replace_val)
set1_stutter %>% group_by(Marker) %>% 
  summarise(Nalleles= n_distinct(Allele), Nstutter = n_distinct(Stutter))

stutterplot <- addColor(set1_stutter, kit = "ESX17") %>% 
  sortMarker(kit = "ESX17", add.missing.levels = TRUE)
compare_dat <- data.frame(Marker = c(ref1$Marker), 
                          perc95 = (c(NA, 11.9, 4.6, 10.9, 10.7,12.1, 12.0, 11.1, 10.4,16.0,
                                     11.4, 9.1, 10.1, 8.3, 14.4, 10.1, 12.8))/100)
compare_dat <- filter(compare_dat, Marker %in% stutterplot$Marker)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = stutterplot, position = position_jitter(width = .1), 
             aes(x = Allele, y = Ratio, color = as.factor(Type)), alpha = .7) + 
  geom_hline(data = compare_dat, aes(yintercept = perc95), linetype = "dotted") + 
  facet_wrap(~Marker, ncol=4, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(x = "True Allele", y= "Stutter Ratio", color = "Type")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:stutter) shows the ratio of stutter for each of the eight control samples in `set1`. The horizontal dotted lines show the 95$^{th}$ percentile of the stutter ratio values computed in the same way from 220 samples in @strval. There are a few stutter values above the dotted line,  but overall the values correspond to what we expect to happen in a sample with only one contributor. Unusual values are shown in Table \@ref(tab:stuthigh).

```{r stutterbig, echo = FALSE}
stutterplot %>% left_join(compare_dat) %>% mutate(large = Ratio > perc95) %>% 
  filter(large) %>% 
  select(Sample.Name:Type, `95th perc.` = perc95) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Stutter peaks larger than the 95th percentile of peak values for the study in @strval.", label = "stuthigh", digits = 3)
```

### Check heterozygote balance (intra-locus balance)

Computing the heterozygote peak balance (Hb) is most important for analyzing samples with two or more contributors. We calculate Hb values for the eight repeated samples in `set1` below using Equation 3 from @strval to compute the ratio. 

```{r hb, fig.cap="Hb ratio values for the eight samples in `set1`. Most ratios are above the 0.6 threshold."}
# checkSubset(data = set3, ref = ref3)
set1_hb <- calculateHb(data = set1.slim, ref = ref1.slim, hb = 3, kit = "ESX17", 
            sex.rm = TRUE, qs.rm = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
hbplot <- addColor(set1_hb, kit = "ESX17") %>% 
  sortMarker(kit = "ESX17", add.missing.levels = TRUE)

ggplot(data = hbplot) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = MPH, y = Hb, color = Dye), position = position_jitter(width = .1)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = .6, linetype = "dotted") + 
  facet_wrap(~Marker, nrow = 4, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "black", "red")) + 
  labs(x = "Mean Peak Height (RFU)", y = "Ratio", color = "Dye") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow=2, byrow=T)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = rel(.8)),  legend.position = c(.89, .1))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:hb) shows the Hb values for the eight samples in `set1`. The balance ratio is typically no less than 0.6 according to @gill97, but there are a few exceptions to this rule in the `set1` sample, shown in Table \@ref(tab:smhb)

```{r which6, echo = FALSE}
set1_hb %>% filter(Hb < .6) %>% knitr::kable(caption = "Observations in the `set1` data which have Hb value less than 0.6.", label = "smhb", digits = 3)
```

<!--Another way to look at the heterozygote balance is with a boxplot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hbbox). 

```{r hbbox}
ggplot(data = hbplot, aes(x = Marker, y = Hb, color = Dye)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .7) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = .6, alpha = .6, linetype = "dotted") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "black", "red")) + 
  labs(x = "Locus", y = "Ratio") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = rel(.8)),  legend.position = "top")

```
-->

### Check inter-locus balance

Inter-locus balance (Lb) is a measure of relative peak hight within a locus. The total height of the peaks in all loci should be spread evenly across each individual locus in a sample. In the `set1` data, 17 loci are measured, thus each individual locus balance should be 

```{r lb}
set1_lb <- calculateLb(data = set1.slim, ref = ref1.slim, kit = "ESX17", option = "prop", 
            by.dye = FALSE, ol.rm = TRUE, sex.rm = FALSE, qs.rm = TRUE,  
            ignore.case = TRUE, na = 0)
set1_height <- calculateHeight(data = set1.slim, ref = ref1.slim, kit = "ESX17", 
                               sex.rm = FALSE, qs.rm = TRUE,na.replace = 0)
set1_lb %>% left_join(
  set1_height %>% 
    select(Sample.Name:Marker, Dye, TPH, H, Expected, Proportion) %>% distinct(), 
  by = c("Sample.Name", "Marker", "Dye", "TPPH" = "TPH")
) -> set1_lb


set1_lb <- sortMarker(set1_lb, kit = "ESX17", add.missing.levels = TRUE)

ggplot(set1_lb) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Marker, y = Lb, color = Dye), alpha = .7) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "black", "red")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1/17, linetype = "dotted") +
  theme(legend.position = "top", axis.text.x = element_text(size = rel(.8)))
```

### Check stochastic threshold
