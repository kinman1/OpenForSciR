## Introduction

In the mess of a crime scene, one of the most abundant pieces of evidence is a shoe outsole impression. A shoe outsole impression is the trace of a shoe that is left behind. The pattern of the sole is transferred to the walking surface. Impressions are also often left in pliable materials such as sand, dirt, snow, or blood. These crime scene impressions are lifted using dusting or casting techniques to obtain the print left behind. The

## Question of interest
Once we find shoe outsole impressions at the crime scene, the question of interest is who left this impression. From the database of shoeprint, we want to find the closest shoeprint image to the questioned shoe impressions to give the hint of shoe brand. Or, if we have information about the suspect's shoes, then we need to investigate whether the questioned shoe impressions show the major similarity with shoes that the suspect have. Statistically, the summary statistic we need to assess is the degree of correspondence between questioned shoe outsole impression ($Q$) and known shoeprint ($K$). If the similarity between $Q$ and $K$ is high enough, then we may conclude that the source for $Q$ and $K$ would be the same. Thus, the goal is how to quantify the degree of correspondence between two shoe outsole impressions.  


## Sources of variability in shoe outsole impressions

There are many characteristics of shoes that are examined. First, the size of the shoe is determined, then the style and manufacturer. These characteristics are known as *class characteristics* because there are many, many shoes that share these characteristics, but they can be used to easily exclude most other shoes. For instance, a very popular shoe in the United States is the Nike Air Force one, pictured below [@fbishoes]. So, seeing a Nike logo and concentric circles in an impression from a Men's size 13 instantly excludes all shoes that are not Nike Air Force Ones in Men's size 13.

Next, *subclass characteristics* are examined. These characteristics are shared by a subset of elements in a class, but not by all elements in the class. In shoe impressions, subclass characteristics usually occur during the manufacturing process. For instance, air bubbles may form in one manufacturing run but not in another. Also, the different molds used to create the same style and size shoes can have slight differences, such as where pattern elements intersect [@mfrshoes]. Just like with class characteristics, subclass characteristics can be used to eliminate possible shoes very easily. 

Finally, the most unique parts of a shoe outsole impression are the randomly acquired characteristics (RACs) left behind. The RACs are smaller knicks, gouges, and debris in soles of shoes that are acquired over time, seemingly at random, as the shoes are worn. These are the *identifying* characteristics of shoe impressions, and examiners look for these irregularities in the crime scene impressions to make an identification. 

To make an identification, a shoe that investigators think could have caused the print is studied for its class, subclass, and randomly acquired characteristics. 

1. Size 
2. Manufacturer (Nike, Adidas, Converse, etc.)
3. Style (Air Force One, Chuck Taylor All-Star, etc.)
4. Mold used in manufacture
5. Other manufacturing process variability
6. Randomly acquired characteristics (RACs)
    a. gouge
    b. rocks
    c. knicks 
7. Transfer of outsole to surface

## Method for matching
There are rich literature on comparison of 2D shoe impressions. Region based, points of interest based.... blah.. 
For the successful matching result, we need two things;(1) Good features that are well-representative to the given shoe impressions and (2) Good matching method to quantify the similarity well between features from $Q$ and $K$.   


### Interest feature
We want to introduce several kinds of interest feature that can be detected from shoe outsole impressions. By identifying points of interest, the selected features are used as a information of given shoeprint. For example, edges (boundaries of patterns) and corners (intersection of patterns) could be possible points of interest. MSER, SIFT, SURF are also possible features to be detected and used as a information to be compared. In this Section, we will use edge detection (by Prewitt operator) as the feature to be compared. By detecting entire edges which are boundaries of patterns of shoe outsole impression, edges will contain class, subclass and possible RACs to uniquely indentify the suspect.   


### Method
MC-COMP on three circular area matching via maximum clique


## Data 

Real data that we can utilize to test a matching algorithm for footwear comparison is very limited with the several reasons; (1) Shoe impressions found at the crime scene is credential because those are a part of evidence to link the suspect, (2)  Although some of real crime scene data is actually available, we don't know the true source of the impression, (3) Since most of shoe impressions found at the crime scene is partial, degraded, blurred or damaged, they are not appropriate to test the performance of developing algorithm.  


CSAFE collected shoe impressions using two-dimensional EverOS footwear scanner (\url{http://www.shopevident.com}{http://www.shopevident.com}). The scanner is designed to scan the shoe outsole as person step onto the scanner by recording the weight distribution. The scanned images are 300 dpi resolution. As more pressure is put on the scanner, then there will be more detailed patterns detected from the outsole. Also, the scanner is not only scanning the outsole details, but also it shows the yellow line of ruler to allow to measure the size of scanned impression. Figure \ref{everos_ex} shows the exmaple impressions scanned from EverOS scanner. First two left shoe images are replicated impressions from the same shoe of ID 1 and two right shoes are also replicated impressions from the same shoe of ID 2. By getting impressions repeatedly, the overall patterns are very similar but there are some measurement differences by different amount of pressure.

This 2D EverOS scanner enables to collect shoe impressions with ground truth. By collecting replicated impressions from the same shoe, the comparison of known mated is possible and by comparing impressions from two different shoe, the known non-mated comparison is available. CSAFE collected a large collection of shoe outsole impressions from EverOS scanner. With this database, we test the performance of developing matching algorithm with the full shoe images and furthermore, we can degrade shoe impressions to mimic the crime scene like images.      


We collected 150 shoes that are used for certain period of time and scanned the outsole impressions 5 times from each of left and right shoes. This results in 1,500 images of shoe outsole impressions. For shoe ID 1, there are 5 impressions from left shoe and 5 impressions from the right shoe. Some of impressions have the exact same shoe brand and model but most of shoes have different class characteristic.  


As a preprocessing step, we used Matlab to down sample all of images at 20%. With the down-sampled images, edges are detected by Prewitt operator. The location of edges are recorded as .csv file. Each edge point has ($x$,$y$) of coordinate information, with lower left corner of (0,0).
