## Introduction

Start with a brief intro to the simplicity of single-source DNA. 

As discussed in Chapter \@ref(dnaval), forensic DNA analysis relies on the counts of alleles at particular loci on the human genome.

There are probabilistic models for determining the number of contributors, how much each person contributed, etc.
