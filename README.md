## Discussion Points

**Disclaimer** I am aware that this 'section' does not belong here. I just do not know where this should be (if anywhere).

- Would it be possible to include shiny apps or references to them in a project like this? It would be appealing for forensic practitioners or forensic scientists to be able to play with the software via a shiny app, like Eric's app or the one that Martin and I are working on (where you will be able to upload your own images, preprocess them and analyze them).
- I believe we could convince Alicia and Soyoung to bundle all their code into an R package to be included in the shoeprints and glass sections as well.
